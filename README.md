# PVH-Exercise-2

- Utilized Storyboard and code at the same time to configure the NavigationBar and the TableView
- Used a callback in order to transfer the schedule data from the ScheduleViewController to the OverviewViewController
- A method sorts the data coming from the callback and reloads the TableView with it
- Written TableView delegate and data source methods as an extension to the view controller to better order the code and create the separation.
- Created a TableViewCell with a nib and added methods to it to set its properties
- Used the extensions created in the previous exercise
